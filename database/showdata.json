    "story": "In Kings of War, director Ivo van Hove focuses on political leadership. The original texts were retranslated by Rob Klinkenberg and then thoroughly adapted: the Hundred Years' War between England and France, and the Rose Wars between the houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne, which are emphatically present as a historical context in the original pieces, were referred to the background in the adaptation in order to accommodate a varied portrait of successive kings. As leaders in times of political instability and war, they show remarkable affinities with world leaders today. Kings of War is not a historical reconstruction, but a performance about power, ambition, leadership and responsibility; a performance in which leaders are confronted with the ultimate decision about the life and death of thousands of citizens and in which they rule from a sense of empathy and justice or are led by an unbridled lust for power.",

    "story": "“Carmen will never surrender, born free, free will she die!” cries Bizet's heroine to Don José at the end of the opera. This irrepressible freedom, coupled with a need to live ever-more intensely, is strongly present in this production directed by Calixto Bieito. With Mérimée, Bieito retains the burning temperament of a woman who lives by small-time trafficking. A test for the ages in this timeless piece, the rebel bird is essentially a creature of our own times; a brazen and indomitable seductress and a product of social and masculine brutality, she lives life in the fast lane, avid for existence.",

    "story": "With Hedda, a portrait of several women, Aurore Fattier immerses us in the last days of rehearsals for Ibsen's famous play Hedda Gabler. Laure Stijn, a theatre director in her forties, is staging the play. As the work progresses, memories of her sister Esther, a young actress who died fifteen years earlier, are revived. The videos and set design help create multiple mirror effects between fiction and reality. In this play, Aurore Fattier chooses not to depict a fascinating heroine confronting her tragic destiny. Rather, she questions this myth and invites us to find in Ibsen's work a different way of telling the story of a woman's life.",
